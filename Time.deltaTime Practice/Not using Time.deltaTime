/*

Shoot() is called on the first frame, then TimeUntilNextAttack is set to 6.
Shoot() is called again once TimeUntilNextAttack = 0.

AttackPeriod (6) is lowered by 0.1 every frame.
To get back down to 0, it will take 60 frames.

Therefore, Shoot() is called every 60 frames.
On 60 FPS: Shoot() is called every 1 second.
On 30 FPS: Shoot() is called every 2 seconds.
