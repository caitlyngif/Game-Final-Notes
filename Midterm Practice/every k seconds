/*

FixedUpdate() is called every 0.02 seconds (50 times per second).
timeRemaining starts at 3 seconds.
timeRemaining is lowered by 0.1 every FixedUpdate() call.
To get back down to 0, it will take 30 FixedUpdate() calls.
Therefore, Print() is called every 30 FixedUpdate() calls.
At 50 FixedUpdate() calls per second, 30 calls takes 0.6 seconds
