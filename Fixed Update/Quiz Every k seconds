/*

The following machine prints every k seconds. What is k if the frame rate is 60 fps?

FixedUpdate() runs every 0.02 seconds.
timeRemaining originally 3.
In every call, timeRemaining is decreased by 0.1.
Print() is called when timeRemaining reaches 0.

This takes 30 calls to FixedUpdate() to get from 3 to 0.
30 * 0.02 seconds = 0.6 seconds
