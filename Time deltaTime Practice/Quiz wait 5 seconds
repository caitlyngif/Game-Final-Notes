/*

We use the following code for a motion sensor. If motion is detected, the light turns on. We then wait 5 seconds and turn off the light. Fill in the blank so the code runs independent of the frame rate.

When Detect() runs,
light = true
waiting set to waitTime (5)

We want the light to stay on for 5 real time seconds, not 5 frames.
For 60 FPS, this means we want 60*5 = 300 Update() calls, or frames
On 60 FPS, Update() is called every frame which is every 1/60 seconds.

Decrease waiting by Time.DeltaTime every frame means:
    waiting decreases by 1/60 every frame
    It takes 300 frames to go from 5 to 0.

Answer: waiting -= Time.deltaTime;
