/*

float value = Time.deltaTime * speed

By using Time.deltaTime * speed, we drop the ball every frame by a fraction of speed based on the frame rate.
If the frame rate is higher, Time.deltaTime is smaller, so the fraction is smaller.
    Drops by less per frame on higher frames, and more per frame on lower frames.
