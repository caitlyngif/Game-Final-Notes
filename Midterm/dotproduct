/*

The player must arrange multiple soldiers so that they form a straight horizontal line, standing side by side, and facing in the same direction. 
To evaluate the arrangement, we compare every pair of soldiers and calculate two scores:
    Score1 is 1 if the two soldiers are almost positioned next to each other in a straight line, and otherwise 0.
    Score2 is 1 if the two soldiers are almost facing the same direction, and otherwise 0.

Both scores should be calculated using the dot product of normalized vectors.
Fill in the blanks with the correct dot product expressions to compute Score1 and Score2.

Hint: Vector3.Dot returns 
1 → perfectly aligned (same direction)
0 → perpendicular
-1 → opposite directions
