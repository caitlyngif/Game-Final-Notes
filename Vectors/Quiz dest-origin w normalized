/*
We are implementing a zombie game where if a zombie detects the player, that is, detectedPlayer is true, 
the zombie chases the player at a constant speed, that is, speed. 
Fill in the blank to calculate the direction in which the zombie should move. 
Note that the zombie’s movement speed is independent of the distance of the zombie from the player.

(player.transform.position - transform.position).normalized

Normalized so that direction has magnitude 1, meaning movement speed is constant.
GetDirection() is only concerned with direction, not movement speed
It should be used with speed and deltaTime outside this function.

/*
Fill in the rest of if(TooFar)

if(tooFar){
    var dir = GetDirection();
    transform.position += dir * speed * Time.deltaTime;
}
