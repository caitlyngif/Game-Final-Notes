/*

We want to throw a dart towards a board at a constant speed and without the influence of gravity.
Which of the following options should be written in the blank to achieve this?

Answer: transform.position += speed * Time.deltaTime * (board.position - transform.position).normalized;

moves the dart to the board at a constant speed, regardless of frame rate
Destination - Origin

Normalized because if not, when the dart's far away from the board, the dart would go extremely fast to the board. 
    if the dart was close, it would be extremely slow to the board.
