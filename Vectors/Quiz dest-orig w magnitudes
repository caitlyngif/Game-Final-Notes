/*

We are implementing a zombie game where if a zombie detects the player, that is, detectedPlayer is true, the zombie chases the player. 
We want the zombie to chase the player while they are farther than a threshold, named th, and otherwise, attack the player. 
Select all the options that we can write in the blank to implement this mechanic. 

Answer:
Vector3.Distance(transform.position, player.transform.position) > th
OR
(transform.position - player.transform.position).sqrMagnitude > th

Destination - Origin
sqrMagnitude gets the magnitude of the Vector, since Vector3.Magnitude is computationally expensive.
